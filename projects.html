                <h3>Library Management System</h3>
                <p>Simple library management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  The project comprised two main classes: Book and Library. The Book class managed attributes such as title, author, and copies. It featured methods for displaying book information, borrowing a book (which decreased the number of available copies), and returning a book (which increased the number of copies). The ‚ÄòLibrary‚Äô class was designed to manage a collection of Book instances. It included methods for adding books to the library's inventory, displaying all books, and finding a specific book by its title. The implementation of these classes demonstrated practical use of OOP concepts like encapsulation and object interaction, providing a foundational understanding of how to structure and manage a simple library system programmatically.</p>

                <h3>Super Market Simulator</h3>
                <p>Developed a Python-based simulation to model and optimise customer flow through supermarket checkout lanes. The project involved creating and managing regular and self-service lanes, dynamically opening and closing lanes based on demand, and generating customers with varying basket sizes. The simulation focused on improving operational efficiency by minimising customer wait times. Key features included a lottery system for promotional purposes and automated lane control. This project demonstrated my proficiency in object-oriented programming through the design of custom classes for lanes and customers, and effective management of system states and behaviours.</p>

                <h3>Task Manager App</h3>
                <p>Developed a dynamic web application that enables users to efficiently manage their tasks using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app features functionalities such as adding, completing, deleting, and filtering tasks, providing a user-friendly interface for effective task management. Implemented Git for version control and hosted the application on GitHub Pages, showcasing my ability to create and deploy interactive web applications.</p>
